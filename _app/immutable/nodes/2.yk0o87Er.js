However, these reforms would soon be overtaken by more radical ideas. Germany would instead develop a series of compromises that would please neither left nor right. They also did not reform key elites including the army, bureaucracy, and religious institutions. Power was eventually handed over to Friedrich Ebert, who implemented two major compromises: the Ebert-Groener pact, which allowed Ebert to use General Groener's army to suppress radical movements as long as he stayed moderate himself, and the Stinnes-Legien agreement, which reorganized labor. This transition of power would also prove futile as Ebert still did not implement economic reform or reform the army.

The Nazi Party subsequently outlawed other parties and warped Germany in his image, changing trade unions to the 'German Labour Front', abolishing the parliament, and combining President and Chancellor to 'Fuhrer'. In March 1933 the first concentration camp was opened in Dachau, which was designed mainly for political opponents and minorities.

The war began as a conflict in Western Europe, but Hitler did not anticipate the difficulty of taking down the United Kingdom. Regardless, Hitler wished to invade the east as well and began a two-front war, and the U.S.'s declaration of war against Japan led to Hitler declaring war on the U.S., even though Germany did not need to immediately come to Japan's defence.

During Hitler's rise to power, other countries noticed Germany's militarization, but did nothing to combat it.
