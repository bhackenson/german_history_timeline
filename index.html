Power was eventually handed over to Friedrich Ebert, who implemented two major compromises: the Ebert-Groener pact, which allowed Ebert to use General Groener's army to suppress radical movements as long as he stayed moderate himself, and the Stinnes-Legien agreement, which reorganized labor.

In March 1933 the first concentration camp was opened in Dachau, which was designed mainly for political opponents and minorities.
