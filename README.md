# App Overview

This application is an interactive timeline of German History from 1815 to 1989. The timeline is broken down into three periods: The Age of Industrialization (1815-1918), The Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany (1918-1945), and the Cold War (1945-1990). Each period has a list of events that have a description, an outline of causes, and the impact of that event. The user can filter for specific topics in the event timeline, search for a particular term in the search box, and expand and collapse periods and events by clicking on the title of the period or event.

# Functions

Filter buttons: Clicking the filter buttons expand the events relevant to the topic of the filter and collapse all others events.
Search box: The search box works much like the command-F/CTRL-F commands on Mac/Windows by finding the terms that match the search text. Clicking on the search box automatically expands all periods and events and turns off all active filters.
Expanding/Collapsing events: Users can click on each period or event title to expand or collapse that period or event if they wish to view certain events and hide others. Doing so will disable any active filters.
